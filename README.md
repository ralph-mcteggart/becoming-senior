# Resources
## Food for thought for seniors / future seniors
- [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) - good companion to some of the books below. Learn how to optimise your learning. Make it easier to pick up new concepts and retain important information.
- [Google docs style guide](https://developers.google.com/style) - check out how Google writes. There are important distinctions between technical and plain English. The approach is interesting.
- [Getting promoted](https://defmacro.substack.com/p/how-to-get-promoted) Should be satirical... Luckily only necessary reading in certain environments. A funny read but also food for thought if this type of behaviour is apparent in your workplace. 
- [Decent overview of becoming senior](https://neilkakkar.com/things-I-learned-to-become-a-senior-software-engineer.html) - actually has some crossover from my talk. It's a decent breakdown.

## Books I recommend
### Tech books
This isn't a technical talk but here's some books I love:
- [Designing data intensive applications](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23463279-designing-data-intensive-applications) - the best technical book I've ever read. Even if not working in a distributed systems environment I think there's a lot of value in it.
- [Release It!](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1069827.Release_It_) - similar disclaimer to above. Introduces the ideas of resilient systems in a nice way and the thought processes behind each section are interesting.
- [Effective Java](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34927404-effective-java) - even if you don't write anything in Java, Joshua has a great way of looking at recurrent problems. I think it's still worth a skim for non Java devs. Absolute must read if you work in Java however.
- [Practical Vim](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13607232-practical-vim) - I'm a massive fan of Vim and obviously this is going to be more useful if a Vim user. BUT, the approach is still enlightening. It delves into why Vim is so powerful as a piece of software and how the philosophy of it works.

### Soft skills
- [Elements of Style](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33514.The_Elements_of_Style) - standard college textbook for writing well. The stuff written in this book is rehashed everywhere. Implement the basics and you'll instantly become a better writer.
- [Pragmatic Thinking and Learning](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3063393-pragmatic-thinking-and-learning) - from the same people who brought us the Pragmatic Programmer. Optimising your learning.
- [Presentation Zen](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1908456.Presentation_Zen) - a little dated but the ideas stand. How to present things in a digestible way (I didn't do this enough in this talk!)

### Diversity
- [Invisible Women](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41104077-invisible-women) - as a man I found this pretty shocking. I definitely learned a lot. In the Irish software industry, the gender imbalance is insane. I feel like every man should read this to get a small insight into the sort of challenges women have to face.

### Misc.
- [Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35167685-surely-you-re-joking-mr-feynman) - not a book to learn from but a good intro to Feynman
- [Striking Thoughts](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/259311.Striking_Thoughts) - obviously a great martial artist but Bruce Lee was also a great philosopher. He talks a lot about the dangers of ego and how to better oneself. It's all snippets of various writings, organised by category, so it's very easy to dip in and out of.


## Tools
### Spaced Repetition
It helps to be able to build foundational knowledge and make sure it is well planted in your brain. I used spaced reptition software (SRS) for this. 

In summary, the best way to remind yourself of something is just before you forget it. You'll then retain that knowledge for a slightly longer time and so you can remind yourself again just before you forget, and repeat. The time between reminders increases dramatically as your brain locks the knowledge in (can you tell I'm not a neuroscientist?!) and so in only a handful of reviews you'll remember the things you've learned for months or years to come.

There's a web app for [Anki](https://ankiweb.net/about), but I recommend getting the native app for whatever platform you use and find your own flow.
Here's a good breakdown of the method:

and the same guy has some great tips on it:

I'm not a fanboy I promise
