# üìö Appetite for learning

## Stretch yourself
## Revisit the basics 
## Teach others

<Notes>

- Isn't innate
- Growth mindset 
- Love to learn (or learn to love to learn)
- Ask for bigger projects
- Revisit the basics. I'll go back and learn something I'm rusty on 
- Teaching others is best way to find out if you really know something.
- This talk is a learning experience for me

# ü¶Å Courage 
 
## Say NO!
## Face the worst case

<Notes>

- Say NO (for you, to give yourself a chance. for those around you, to give them a chance)
- Raise what no one else will
- Think about worst cases and account for them. Don't shy away
